We will use the dataset that comes  directly from the New Zealand Transport Agency and could be gotten from this website:- data.govt.nz

The dataset comes in a hybrid mode; meaning we have both categorical and numerical features. This allows us to treat the problem from a
mathematical approach and to use predictive models such as Linear Regression and KNN, amongs others.
We then use performance metrics such as F Scores, R2, ROC curves, and  precision accuracy, to test the accuracy of our predictions.
